# The Wolf's Tale
This text-based game was created to showcase the tools learned in Python as part of my master's degree coursework. The project's goal was to adapt a popular intellectual property (IP) and create a new interactive story, while taking into account the structure of different game stages, user experience, replayability, and the limitation of relying only on Python tools.

## Game Description
In this game, the player takes the role of the wolf in the classic bedtime story "The Three Little Pigs". The objective is to navigate through different game stages, catch all the pigs, and avoid the traps.

## Technical Requirements
To build this game, the following programming concepts were used:

* Strings and string manipulation<br>
* User-defined functions and objects (variables)<br>
* User input and input handling<br>
* Conditional and nested conditional statements (if/elif/else)<br>
* Loops (for/while)<br>
* Controlling for errors (try/except)<br>
* Additionally, the game was designed to not use global variables and must be completed within three minutes.<br>

## How to Play
To play the game, simply run the Python script and follow the on-screen instructions. You will be prompted to make decisions and navigate through different stages of the game. Make sure to read the instructions carefully and think strategically to catch all the pigs and avoid the traps.
